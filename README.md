This is the official guide for _Hourglass_, the tool to systematically interrogate multiparametric datasets in a semi-automated manner. It allows users to filter and subset large datasets and compare groups in an automated manner. Hourglass exists as a stand-alone open-source R package and an accompanying graphical user interface (GUI) as a cross-platform desktop application.
