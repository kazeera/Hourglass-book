[["index.html", "Users Guide for Hourglass 1 About", " Users Guide for Hourglass Kazeera Aliar last revised Aug 22, 2022 1 About This is the official guide for Hourglass, the tool to systematically interrogate multiparametric datasets in a semi-automated manner. It allows users to filter, subset datasets and perform the analysis under identical settings at the global, regional and patient-paired levels to systematically identify communalities and differences. Hourglass exists as a stand-alone open-source R package and a desktop application for Windows. Please refer to our link paper for more info. Figure 1.1: The Hourglass logo. Acknowledgements We are ready to share Hourglass with the world. Its about time. First of all, I would like to thank Dr. Barbara Gruenwald, whose role cannot be overstated. She is the phenomenal force that helped conceptualize this toolbox and drove this project forward. It started off as a script, with 300 lines of code in a single for loop, and progressively grew bigger as we added more stains and figured out new ways to interrogate the data. Next, I would like to thank Henry Waterhouse, who built the graphical user interface with me, from planning to launch. Foram Vyas, Emily Poulton, and Nathan Chan are the image analysis experts who quantified the IHC data and consistently offered intelligent and creative feedback. I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Rama Khokha, Dr. Paul Waterhouse, and the rest of the Khokha Lab for sharing your excitement about Hourglass. I also would like to thank the developers of R, python, and Kivy for facilitating the making of Hourglass, the StackOverflow community for having the answers to everything, Github for providing a platform in which this program is easily accessible, and RStudio for creating R markdown and bookdown to facilitate the making of the R package and this book.

To facilitate exploration of multi-parametric data (especially bioimage quantification). For who? Individuals who need their data plotted hands-free. How? Provide user preferences to filter and subset large datasets and compare groups in an automated manner. 2.2 Roadmap Figure 2.1: Schematic depicting Hourglass pipeline. Top: Collecting data. Middle: Hourglass. Bottom: Output visualizations in structured folder hierarchy. 2.3 Is this tool for me? What is it optimal for? Multiparametric data analysis Systematic data interrogation Explores multiple groups Wide range of plotting functions Method of quality control What can it do, but is not optimal for? Omics visualization, i.e. any numeric dataset with annotations What can it not do? Integration of multiple independent datasets, e.g. cant compare proteome vs transcriptome Image analysis, i.e. read and interpret raw image files 2.4 Terminology Annotation = any discrete label or description for features/parameters and patients/samples. See Input Data for more information. Patient or sample annotations are another layer of data that we can add to an already multi-parametric data. Figure 2.2: Patients have different labels or annotations. Feature = stains, genes, markers, etc (e.g. Gene1, ProteinX, IL6) Parameters = readouts, measurements of features (e.g. Numbers of Positive Pixels, Percent Positive Pixels, Stained Area mm^2,Total Area mm^2) Figure 2.3: Columns in stain data can also have labels or annotations. Multiparametric = data with more than two dimensions, results from multiple parameters being measured from features. For example, from methods such as Immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunomasscytometry (IMC), etc. If we look at the feature IL6, using bioimage analysis tools, we can measure many readouts from one feature, such as: IL6 &gt; Number of positive pixels AND Area AND Positive Pixel percent vs. Uniparametric = data from methods such as microarray, transcriptomics, proteomics, etc. If we look at the same feature IL6, using traditional omics, we get a single readout from one feature, such as: IL6 &gt; protein abundance OR gene expression 2.5 By-Patient vs. By-Sample In addition to enabling a highly systematic visualization of multiple research questions within the integrated dataset, Hourglass is designed to enable this structured analysis across multiple levels. Specifically, Hourglass is designed to leverage the fact that bioimaging datasets are typically recorded from multiple samples per patient. For example, TMAs comprise multiple samples per patient while IMC and spatial omic methods usually record multiple regions of interest (ROIs) per patient. Figure 2.4: Hourglass can compare annotations at the patient or sample level. Hourglass accesses all levels of this unique data structure: ROIs/samples per patient may be averaged for by-patient analysis, run in parallel as individual sample analysis and, furthermore, be aggregated as patient-matched samples. Hourglass thereby accelerates exploration and direct comparison of regional versus global versus patient-paired features for each patient, providing a comprehensive overview over inter- and intratumoral stain differences. The multiple levels are (see below for description): Figure 2.5: Patients have different labels or annotations. Global/ByPatient: Typically, TMA-derived datasets comprising multiple samples per patient are averaged. Because there are multiple samples per patient, common practice is to collapse to a patient level by averaging samples across patients commonly done for this type of dataset on a by-patient basis. Collapsing our dataset resulted in patient x feature-parameter matrix dimensions of 165 x 631, with a total of 104,115 data points. For example, we could now compare IL6 hi vs IL6 low patients. Regional/BySample: This analysis is performed to figure out when intratumoral heterogeneity can be increasingly appreciated as a key factor in X. We saw a specific opportunity to dissolve those regions and look at heterogeneity across samples, so this is a specific angle that we implemented in Hourglass. For example, IL6 hi vs IL6 low regions across all samples. Patient-Paired: To analyze intrapatient heterogeneity, Hourglass can also create slopegraphs to resolve regional differences in a patient-paired manner. For example, for comparison of IL6 hi vs IL6 low regions within the same tumors. Hourglass averages the values and plots a graph in which the means of each group are paired. For example, tumor subtypes may vary across samples or ROIs in the same patient. If four samples from a patient are tumor subtype A and three are B, the means of these 2 groups are connected directly by a line and this comparison can be statistically assessed for all patients. These different analysis levels can be utilized alone or in combination, i.e. the user can easily focus on standard per-patient analysis only or perform the analysis under identical settings at the global, regional and patient-paired levels to systematically identify communalities and differences. For example, if regional differences are driving global trends then we know that either or both heterogeneity and sampling bias is relevant in this research question. 2.6 Comparisons and Feature Sets Figure 2.6: The Hourglass Workflow (left to right). Hourglass enables versions of comparisons Multiple versions of an analysis can be submitted in parallel to the same Hourglass run, enabling direct comparison of the results. In the case of a main comparison of IL6 high vs IL6 low patients, the user can submit additional versions of this analysis to directly compare if IL6-related differences could be sex-specific or subtype-specific. When interacting with their data, users can thereby easily focus on different parameters and biological differences while having fixed analysis settings (same feature sets, correlation method, two-tailed p-value test). This facilitates systematic recognition and investigation of side/sub-correlations or confounding factors that may have otherwise been overlooked. Consequently, Hourglass provides automated large-scale integrated analysis with and without inclusion of different subgroups of patients or samples. This allows users to gain a quick and comprehensive overview of how different subgroups might be affecting their results. Hourglass enables targeted analysis and grouping of feature sets Often-times a dataset may contain features that are not of interest to a specific question or, related to this, sets of features that are biologically related (e.g. T cell stains CD3, CD8, FoxP3). Thus, extensive analysis customization options were implemented in Hourglass. This optional analysis step allows for related parameters and features to be grouped together in composite plots, which is referred to as feature sets. For example, users may define T cell and B cell marker sets (set 1 and 2). Users can then furthermore create super-sets from sets, such as immune markers from B cell and T cell sets, to be displayed in custom composite plots as depicted in the heatmap. Any combination of features and parameters can be used to create a set, which enables easy but powerful customization of the numerous and partially related features within complex datasets. Hourglass was designed to take in a general data format with user options and instantaneously generate a wealth of information. The power lies in the manipulation of both axes of a numeric sample by feature matrix: the labeling and filtering of rows (patients/samples), and the subsetting of columns (features/parameters) Any label that is assigned to patients can be used as a main comparison. For example, in an Hourglass-independent manner, annotations for patients can be derived from transcriptomic data such as Moffitt subtypes or genomic calls such as KRAS wild-type vs KRAS mutated. On the other axis, biologically relevant features and corresponding parameters can be grouped to make feature sets such as T cell markers and immune markers. Consequently, by compounding multiple sets with multiple sample or patient comparisons, the potential for data exploration is exponentiated. Figure 2.7: New annotations can be added prior to running Hourglass. For example, transcriptional profiles of pancreatic cancer can be used to determine Moffitt molecular subtype. 2.7 Strengths There are multiple benefits of using Hourglass as a framework for multiparametric dataset interrogation. Accessibility Accessible for non-expert users, fully reproducible and open-source. Makes publication-ready plots via robust and automated pipeline reduces manual work. Leverages metrics of heterogeneity from standard tissue microarray designs. Query and Exploration Customizable and endless combinations of selections of what labels/annotations to compare. Thus, multiple layers of information from TMAs are extracted but can only be understood or interpreted via a smart way of visualizing the data to make sense of it. Hourglass is the tool to subset, integrate, and pick specific parameters to appreciate all of the information from a dataset. Different levels of analysis (global or by patient vs regional or by sample) can be run. Common practice is to average these values and collapse by patient, however a wealth of information is contained in the sample data and intra-patient differences. Resolves regional vs global differences via paired analysis and heterogeneity barplots. Multiple layers of information from TMAs are extracted but can only be understood or interpreted via a smart way of visualizing the data to make sense of it. Reproducibility As the nature of such analyses is iterative, and users often return to refine or add to an analysis after extended periods of time, Hourglass supports a high level of reproducibility. Each analysis produces a report (Excel file) sufficient to easily reproduce that analysis and also produce different additional versions of that analysis with identical settings. Data cleaning and wrangling Subset input table with all parameters to be compared Filtering - Incorporates exclusion/inclusion criteria, within subgroups. For example, a researcher may want to exclude certain patient subgroups or focus on a subset of a 40 stain panel or pre-treated patients may be excluded to observe the effects of basic biology. Imputation for dropouts. Often, datasets are patchy containing NA values. Supports removal of outliers below the first quartile and above the third. 2.8 Limitations Hourglass facilitates efficient knowledge extraction from complex datasets. However, it does have certain weaknesses. Minimum number of stains for it to be useful It is not useful when you have 5 samples and one stain/ typical use case when you have the two. You can still benefit from subsetting. Feature sets have to contain 3 or more features in order to be visualized. Time commitment While Hourglass automatically creates publication-ready plots, it is still semi-automated, the semi meaning that you as a user are required to do some work. Firstly, Hourglass requires user tailors its input parameters to guide the analysis. Next, hundreds to thousands of plots will be created. While you may be swimming in a pool of beautiful plots, it may become tedious to look through all the files. However, the organized file output structure seeks to mitigate this through order of folder names: By Patient/By Sample &gt; Imputed or not &gt; Comparison &gt; Feature Set "],["installation.html", "3 Installation 3.1 Install R 3.2 Install Desktop Application 3.3 Install R package (optional) 3.4 Uninstall 3.5 Troubleshooting", " 3 Installation 3.1 Install R Note: R is a statistical environment / programming language used by Hourglass.

Missing values should be denoted NA or left blank (not nan, N/A, NA) 4.2 The 3 Files Your dataset comprises of 3 tables or files: The file descriptors are named below with abbreviations in brackets. For R package users, these are names of elements in the dataset (ds) list object. Figure 4.1: Snippet of the three files/tables required for Hourglass: 1) values matrix, 2) metadata/annotations for columns of values matrix, and 3) metadata/annotations for rows of values matrix. 1. Numeric matrix (or numMat) = Numeric values from quantification, where rows (samples/patients) x columns (genes/features/parameters). For example, for RNA sequencing data: data matrix = expression matrix, columns = genes, rows = samples. 2. Column Annotations (or colAnn) Annotations/descriptors for columns in numMat. At least two columns are needed for Feature and Parameter (can be called something else). = Feature/parameter information, describes the columns of numMat. First column must be the column names of numMat. Descriptive columns names in data (recommended), e.g. feature_parameter For example, for the column IL6.Number.of.Positive.Pixels, the feature is IL6 and parameter is Number.of.Positive.Pixels. For the column Gene1_woo_ahaha_Area, the feature is Gene1 and parameter is Area, which will be reflected in the colAnn columns. Hourglass also subsets columns based on a column called Keep.In.Analysis - TRUE to keep, FALSE to discard. 3. Row Annotations (or rowAnn) Annotations/descriptors for patient/sample in numMat = Sample/patient information, describes the rows of numMat. First column must be the row names of numMat. These are labels or groups that will define main comparisons or groups to compare or for exclusion/inclusion of patients/samples (e.g. removing smokers) Examples For samples: Tissue type Sample_Cancer_Subtype For patients: Patient_Cancer_Subtype Smoker Age at diagnosis A column for PatientID is required (can be called something else) for paired analysis (i.e. averaging samples from the same patient) and patient level analysis (i.e. averaging samples from the same patient). Note: this is external information from clinical charts / prior analysis that is integrated manually prior to running Hourglass. This means transcriptomic, genomic, and clinical calls are created independently of Hourglass and merged to the master rowAnn table via sample or patient identifiers. 4.3 Similar Format The data input was inspired by popular bioinformatics packages, with numeric data plus metadata. Struct is a package in which a simple DatasetExperiment object contains sample measurements, sample metadata, variable metadata. Figure 1 here. SingleCellExperiment object contains primary and transformed data (cell x feature matrix) and reads in feature and cell metadata. This is similar to Hourglass running the original and imputed versions in the same run. Figure 4.1 here. SummarizedExperiment object similarly contains multiple assays (feature by sample matrices) with colData and rowData. Section 2 here. 4.4 Example Dataset We included an example multiparametric dataset with annotations for patients/samples. This is an entirely fake dataset. Its purpose is to showcase the functionalities of Hourglass and help users recreate plots seen here. These values have no biological relevance or connection to literature. Parameters and annotation labels were inspired by the quantified immunohistochemistry dataset for pancreatic cancer tissue microarray. Features of example dataset 30 patients with 1-6 samples per patient 102 samples in total (rows) Features The following stains (referred to as features see Terminology) were quantified: CD3, CD8 (which are T Cell markers) CD20, CD27, CD5, PDL1 (B Cell markers) IL6, SMA (other) Parameters The parameters measured for each feature are: Area = area of tissue image in mm^2 (random) Num.Detections = number of detected pixels on tissue area = Num.Positive + Num.Negative Num.Negative = number of pixels of negative staining (random) Num.Positive = number of pixels of positive staining (based on trends), affects the following: Positive.Percent = Num.Positive / Num.Detections x 100 Negative.Percent = 100 - Positive.Percent Pos.Pixel.Percent = Num.Positive/10^3 x random value from 0.3 to 1.5 Num.Pos.per.mm.2 = Num.Positive / Area x 10^4 Possible Feature Sets TCell = CD3, CD8 BCell = CD20, CD27, CD5, PDL1 Immune = TCell, BCell All = Immune, IL6, SMA Possible Feature Parameters Num.Pos.per.mm.2 Pos.Pixel.Percent Summary of Trends Most values differ/segregate based on 3 sample cancer subtypes (A, B and C). When there are more than 2 samples per patient, there is a predominant Patient Cancer Subtype but some samples might deviate from this (ie. intrapatient heterogeneity). The following trends are: Overall survival is low for A, medium for B, high for C Average values for TCell (overall low) vs. BCell (overall high) Only for TCells: Het.Score low for A, medium for B, high for C Smokers for all subtypes for TCell stains are high Only for BCells: NeoAdjuvant values are lower IL6 different between A,B,C subtypes only seen in females (Sex==F) No trend in SMA Random outliers (very high value, 4 per row) and random NAs (8 per row) How to Access Files Download 3 csv files here, file names: Example_IHC_sample_colAnn.csv (colAnn) Example_IHC_sample_rowAnn.csv (rowAnn) Example_IHC_sample_vals.csv (numMat) A corresponding example analysis that is the output of the desktop application, serves as the log file for user options and serves input into the R side (See Output: Excel File can downloaded found here).

No actions are required by the user. Press the next tab Upload Files to start. Figure 5.2: Welcome. 5.3 Upload Files This tab specifies input data paths that will 1 - customize the users experience (in this application) and 2 - be used in Hourglass analysis runs. Enter the name of your dataset in text input field (Enter Text Here). Use Choose File buttons to upload the required 3 data files from your computer, specifically: numMat - numeric matrix file rowAnn - row annotations (clinical and sample descriptions) colAnn - column annotations (feature and parameter descriptions). Check The 3 Files for table formatting details and supported file types. Figure 5.3: Upload data. 5.4 Define Comparisons This tab creates a table of comparisons on how to stratify patients or samples. Each comparison/row will be run independent of other comparisons. Figure 5.4: Pick comparisons. Select Patient ID from the drop down menu displaying rowAnn column names. It will be used to group samples belonging to the same patient in By Patient analysis and patient-paired slopegraphs. Skip this step if patient-level analysis is not required. Press the Add a comparison button to add a new comparison and fill in the option fields: Note: All text input fields are case-sensitive, i.e. must match data. Main or Custom Comparison Define a comparison for each row (required), by either: Selecting a Main Comparison from the drop down menu displaying rowAnn column names (e.g. smoker, age group) Filling Custom Comparison - type in the exact column name of a variable from numMat (feature+parameter e.g. IL6_num.positive.pixels) or from rowAnn (e.g. age) Customize comparison with optional fields: Subgroup Select a Subgroup from the drop down menu displaying rowAnn column names (e.g. smoker, age group). This is only for a secondary color coding of dots in boxplots and an extra annotation color bar in heatmaps. {insert 2 boxplot images with and without colored dots} Within Group This will run Hourglass within groups or cohorts of sample/patients. Append rowAnn column names with ;. e.g. Sex;Smoker Filter Specify exclusion criteria with this format: rowAnn_columnname != variable to exclude or rowAnn_columnname == variable to keep. e.g. Smoker==Yes - this keeps all smokers and excludes all other samples/patients from analysis. Ensure that Smoker is a column in rowAnn and Yes is one of its column values. Choose multiple filters by appending filters with ;, e.g. Smoker==Yes;NeoAdjuvant!=neo By Sample Check box to create plots from original input files, treating each row in numMat as an individual data point. By Patient Check box to average across Patient ID (see below) and create plots. Note: at least one of By Sample or By Patient must be selected for comparison to run. Example of a comparison: Field Value Description Main comparison Since main comparison is empty, custom comparison must be defined Custom comparison IL6_Number.Positive.Pixels Compare IL6 high vs low groups (# intermediate depends on the Number of custom levels in Advanced Options tab) Subgroup Smoker Color code boxplot dots by Yes or No (values in Smoker column) Within Group Sex;Smoker Run Hourglass for all samples/patients. Then rerun within male cohort and female cohort. Run within Smoker-Yes, then Smoker-No cohort. Filter NeoAdjuvant != neo Before running this comparison, remove all samples/patient rows that are neo. By Sample (checked) Run this comparison at the sample-level. By Patient (checked) Run this comparison at the patient-level (average the multiple samples per patient). 5.5 Define Feature Sets This tab allows users to pick biologically relevant parameters for each feature and group them as feature sets. Tab 1: Select columns Select column name from colAnn for Feature and Parameter columns. Recall Terminology: Feature = stains, genes, markers, etc (e.g. Gene1, ProteinX, IL6), while Parameters = readouts, measurements of features (e.g. Numbers of Positive Pixels, Percent Positive Pixels, Stained Area mm^2,Total Area mm^2). Figure 5.5: Select columns for feature sets. Tab 2: Define parameters Using drop-down menus, pick relevant parameters for each feature (called standard) and optionally, an alternative. Note: this will populate the table/sheet in the output Excel file called Feature Parameters. Figure 5.6: Define feature set parameters. Tab 3: Define sets Next, define feature sets. Press the Add a row button to add a new set. Name of group: Type in a name for group, e.g. T_cell_markers. List of features: Type in a list of features (see Tab1 for options) or group names, appended with comma. - The delimiter must be a comma, leading and trailing whitespace will be ignored. - Minimum of 3 features. - Case-sensitive. Figure 5.7: Define feature sets. Example of feature sets: Group Name Group List Alternative TCell CD3, CD8 BCell CD20, CD27, CD5, PDL1 immune TCell, BCell all immune, IL6, SMA Alt (Alternative): Select Alt-Yes to run this set with standard AND alternative parameters separately, or Alt-No for a run with standard parameters. Note if Alt-Yes is selected, there will be two folders for a feature set, one with the original name and another with _alt appended, e.g. TCell for standard parameters and TCell_alt for alternative. Note: this will populate the table/worksheet in the output Excel file called Feature Sets. 5.6 Advanced Options This tab includes customization for statistics, plot types, etc. Figure 5.8: Define feature sets. Labels for options are on the left and drop down menus on the right side: Correlation method: Method for correlation between two variables. Options are pearson (linear relationship using raw data), orspearman,kendall f(monotonic relationship using ranked data). Test method: Which two-sample test should be used? Students t-test for parametric data, wilcoxon usually for non-parametric. p-values label: How p (significance) values are to be represented in boxplots, correlation plots, p-value/fold-change heatmap. Stars or exact numeric values. Fold-change method: Fold change computation method to use, either divide (for non-transformed values) or subtract (for log2-transformed values). Color gradient: Color palette for scaled plot types: heatmaps, correlation plots. See color palettes (visual) by pressing the button See color gradients. Number of custom levels: Number of intermediate groups resulting from Hourglass separating a continuous variable into low, int, high. For example, if 2 is selected, there will only be low and high groups, whereas if 4 is selected, the groups will be low, int1, int2, high. Save ID data to file: Would you like sample/patient IDs and corresponding comparison groups to be saved to a .csv table? If TRUE is selected, then yes. This may be useful to 1) identify how Hourglass stratified custom comparisons, i.e. which patient IDs were considers low, int, high in the analysis and 2) see which samples/patients were in analysis after filtering steps. Survival analysis options: Check box (Run survival analysis) to specify creation of survival plots. Survival time column: Time starting from a predefined point to the occurrence of the event of interest, usually OS time (overall survival time - time from diagnosis to death. Censoring status column: Numeric event status represented by 0 and 1 for each patient, where 1 indicates the event has occurred and 1 means the status is incomplete. A patient is censored when we dont know the true survival time for that patient. The two columns above must be in rowAnn table. Additional options: Discrete parameters: Manually type in list of parameters (appended by ,) in numMat that are to be viewed discretely, not continuous as Hourglass assumes. e.g. Het.Score might have values from 1 to 10. Remove outliers: Check box. If selected, outliers will be removed columnwise for all runs (included imputed version) based on the IQR method. Any observations that are more than 1.5 IQR below Q1 or more than 1.5 IQR above Q3 are considered outliers and become NAs. Run imputed version: + Check box to run imputed analysis in parallel. This indicates that all comparisons at sample and patient level will be run Hourglass + Move slider to specify the extent of imputation. Missing data points in numMat will be imputed columnwise with a random value plus or minus x% around the mean of each column, default is 5%. 5.7 Customize Colors This tab contains buttons for each unique value in all comparisons. A button for each unique value in defined comparisons will automatically be displayed. For example, if Cancer Type was chosen as a main comparison, corresponding buttons for lung, breast, pancreatic, and other values in the Cancer Type column will be displayed. Figure 5.9: Customize colors. Press the button to open a color picker window. Select a color by: Entering a hex code in the text input field at the bottom of the left panel. Placing and clicking cursor on the color wheel. Move slider. Press Select and Close Window to save. If white is chosen (center of the color wheel), that value will be excluded from all comparisons. This will bypass filters in comparisons. For example, perhaps Sex in rowAnn has the values F, M and X, where X does not have high enough patient numbers. To exclude this group, make the Sex-X button white. Press Select to choose colors. Note: the information will help populate the table/sheet in the output Excel file called Colors. 5.8 Run Hourglass This tab is the final tab that defines which plot types should be created in output folder Figure 5.10: Run Hourglass. Check boxes for quality control boxplots, for the feature and parameter colAnn columns (optional). See Quality Control (QC) Plots. Note this uses information from Feature Sets Tab 1. Check boxes for plots that will be created for each feature set. Either press: Create output spreadsheet button and navigate through the folder directory and save the Excel file locally. Modify if needed before pressing Run. OR press Upload existing spreadsheet and find and upload a locally existing Excel file. Finally! Press the Run Hourglass button which interfaces to R (back-end). Hourglass will read from the Output: Excel File. This action will relay user options and data file paths to the Hourglass R package and calls on functions to run comparisons using established R plotting libraries, such as ggplot2 and pheatmap. See Output Plot Types for more information. An error window will pop up if there are any issues running Hourglass. 5.9 Output: Excel File The purpose of this application is to create an Excel file that will be read into R act as a log file for run specifications Download output Excel file template here. There are the 4 tables/worksheets: No. Name Description 1 Comparisons comparisons and other analysis parameters (e.g, local file paths to data, survival columns, which plots to create) 2 Colors color palette for values in comparisons, first column is name and second is color hex code 3 Feature Sets named groups of features 4 Feature Parameters standard and optionally alternative parameters for the feature sets You may manually add/modify specific run parameters here. For example, it may be laborious to retype all feature sets, so if the input data is the same, you could copy/paste from a previous run/table and upload to Hourglass. 1. Comparisons This worksheet contains specifications for each run. The first column must be the exact names of the user options and the proceeding columns are comparisons, where each column is a comparison. Figure 5.11: Example of Comparisons worksheet in output Excel file. The first rows (MainComparison to ByPatient) reflect the comparison table in Define Comparisons, while the rest are options selected from other tabs (e.g. Advanced Options, Run Hourglass) 2. Colors This worksheet contains hex-codes for colors in comparisons (form: #123456ff, where ff means full opacity) from Customize Colors. For example, if Sex was selected as a MainComparison, the strata Sex-F and Sex-M will show up here. If youd like to exclude an option(e.g. Sex-X due to low patient number), set to white #ffffffff or do not include and it will be removed from all comparisons with Sex. This may be useful if you have high,int,low for a CustomComparison (see [Pick Comparisons] for definition) - if the intermediate group is to be excluded, delete the Custom-int row. Colors are the same for all unique strata for consistency. For example, Patient_Cancer_Subtype-A, Sample_Cancer_Subtype-A, Sex-A, Smoker-A, Random-A all have the strata A and therefore will be the same color (ie first color defined, duplicates are ignored).

Once you have installed Hourglass, load it into R using the following code: library(Hourglass) 6.3 Usage The best way to run Hourglass is from the Output: Excel File. Download a template here. Note: Keep in mind that all inputs are case-sensitive! run_from_excel(&quot;path/to/excel.xlsx) Hourglass plots will be created in this directory. 6.4 Dataset Object Note: ds = dataset Similar to tools that explore omics and meta data structures, Hourglass characteristically takes in three data input files as part of the dataset object: In R: dataset or ds is a list object. You can access the following elements using the $ operator. Element Name Description Data Structure Code to Access name The name of dataset or experiment String ds$name vals Numeric matrix numMat (rows = patients/samples; columns = features/parameters) Data frame ds$mat rowAnn Row annotations/metadata (describes rows or samples/patients) Data frame ds$rowAnn colAnn Column annotations (describes columns or features of numeric matrix) Data frame ds$colAnn To create the dataset object, use Hourglass::make_dataset_ob(), and pass in 3 dataframes for vals, rowAnn, and colAnn. You may use the Hourglass::read_file() function to import tab or comma delimited files (see The 3 Files). ds &lt;- make_dataset_ob( vals = read_file(&quot;ExampleData2/Example_IHC_sample_vals.csv&quot;), colAnn = read_file(&quot;ExampleData2/Example_IHC_sample_colAnn.csv&quot;), rowAnn = read_file(&quot;ExampleData2/Example_IHC_sample_rowAnn.csv&quot;), remove_outliers = T ) 6.5 Example Dataset in R This is a built-in dataset object in the Hourglass R package. Rename the example dataset variable (to make it smaller). ds &lt;- Hourglass::example_IHC_samples_dataset Since ds is a list object in R, the $ operator can be used to access individual elements (type data.frame).

Figure 7.2: Heterogeneity barplot stacked (first image) and filled to 100% (second) created by Hourglass. Survival Plot Determines survival outcome via plotting of Kaplan Meier curve, logrank test, and tables containing patient counts. Only performed on patients (not samples). Figure 7.3: Survival curve created by Hourglass. Paired Patient Slopegraph Enables screening of any intra-patient differences that may be reflective of heterogeneity. Points are averaged values across strata per patient. Lines connect different averages within patients. Figure 7.4: Patient paired plot created by Hourglass. Discrete Barplot Visualizes discrete values of a parameter in each stain, that is, numeric in the input data but should be considered discrete. E.g. A parameter called Heterogeneity Score contains values 1-10 but should be 1, 2, .. 10. Figure 7.5: Plot showing discrete parameters created by Hourglass. Overview Boxplot Screen primary data for interesting relationships in one plot and significance associations. Figure 7.6: Overview boxplot with statistics created by Hourglass. Individual Boxplot Visualizes data points for each features/parameter combination and relevant statistics from comparing strata. Figure 7.7: Individual boxplot created by Hourglass. Profile Barplot Compare set of markers across different strata for each patient/sample. Figure 7.8: Profile barplot stacked (first) and filled to 100% (second), created by Hourglass. Expression Heatmap Provides overview of patterns in stain data. When there are no NA/missing values (in imputed version for example), values will be clustered using unsupervised hierarchal clustering. Figure 7.9: Heatmap showing expression of features, created by Hourglass. Fold-change (FC) p-value Heatmap Screen for patterns of fold-changes between strata in comparisons and overall significance seen in individuals boxplots. Fold-changes of strata are shown as color gradient and significance between two groups are presented as stars/numbers. Figure 7.10: Plot showing fold-change values (color gradients) and p-values (stars/number), created by Hourglass. Correlation Plot Provides correlations between cell communities and their interactions, e.g. of an insight that can be drawn: correlations between fibroblast markers in one cancer subtype and anti-correlated with immune cells in another. Can only be performed on imputed (no missing values) dataset. spearman or pearson Only created when there are no NA/missing values - for example in 1) imputed version, and 2) complete rows in feature sets. Figure 7.11: Correlation plot created by Hourglass. Correlation Scatter Plot Provides details of correlations, such as regression, scatter plots, correlation coefficients and significant and histograms of values used. Can only be performed on imputed (no missing values) dataset. Only created when there are no NA/missing values - for example in 1) imputed version, and 2) complete rows in feature setsc Figure 7.12: Correlation scatter plot created by Hourglass.

For example, the overall number of positive cells for that stain is higher in high groups (a problem). Verify that a specific metric or data point exists for a stain. Visualized using boxplots (individual and overview). Types: QC Feature: Plot all parameters present for a feature, split by comparison. Note: If your feature column parameter is called Stain, this folder will be called QC Stain in the output folder. Figure 7.14: Example of a QC feature overview boxplot (all parameters measured for CD3). QC Parameter: Plot all features present for a parameter, split by comparison Figure 7.15: Example of a QC parameter overview boxplot (all features that have a readout for Num.Pos.per.mm.2). 7.5 Feature Sets Plots Purpose: * Group relevant features (e.g. biologically relevant). See Define Feature Sets for workflow/user specifications. Briefly: Step 1: Specify relevant parameters for each stain. * If multiple parameters are present per feature (usually the case in multiparametric imaging data), most will be irrelevant/for QC. The final readout is usually a ratio: (1) /(2), where (1) is quantification metric and (2) is normalization metric. Step 2: Make groups, the data integration step. * Look at a stain in context of other stains within the dataset. Make smaller groups (e.g. T cell, immune, stromal cell features). * Multiple plot types are supported for feature sets. groups (from comparison from row annotations) = e.g. Smoker-Yes, Smoker-No "]]
