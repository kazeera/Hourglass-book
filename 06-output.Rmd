# Output Plot Types

## Navigating Output Folder

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align = "center", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Hourglass Output Folder Hierarchy."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/output_overview.png"))
```

See: Video tutorial.

## Descriptions

1. **Heterogeneity Barplot** 
+ Visualizes sample compositon (or expression levels within samples) in patients, indicative of intrapatient heterogeneity.
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%", fig.align = "center", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Heterogeneity barplot stacked (first image) and filled to 100% (second) created by Hourglass."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/plots/hetplot stacked.png", "images/plots/hetplot filled.png"))
```

2.  **Survival Plot**
+ Determines survival outcome via plotting of Kaplan Meier curve, logrank test, and tables containing patient counts. Only performed on patients (not samples).
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align = "center", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Survival curve created by Hourglass."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/plots/survival.png"))
```

3.  **Paired Patient Slopegraph**
+ Enables screening of any intra-patient differences that may be reflective of heterogeneity. Points are averaged values across strata per patient. Lines connect different averages within patients.
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%", fig.align = "center", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Patient paired plot created by Hourglass."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/plots/paired.png"))
```

4.  **Discrete Barplot**
+ Visualizes discrete values of a parameter in each stain, that is, numeric in the input data but should be considered discrete. E.g. A parameter called "Heterogeneity Score" contains values 1-10 but should be "1", "2", .. "10".
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align = "center", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Plot showing discrete parameters created by Hourglass."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/plots/discrete barplot.png"))
```

5.  **Overview Boxplot** 
+ Screen primary data for interesting relationships in one plot and significance associations.
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align = "center", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Overview boxplot with statistics created by Hourglass."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/plots/boxplot overview.png"))
```

6.  **Individual Boxplot**
+ Visualizes data points for each features/parameter combination and relevant statistics from comparing strata.
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="45%", fig.align = "center", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Individual boxplot (left) and example with real data (right) created by Hourglass."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/plots/boxplot indiv.png", "images/plots/example/boxplot indiv ex.png"))
```

7.  **Profile Barplot**
+ Compare set of markers across different strata for each patient/sample.
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="45%", fig.align = "center", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Profile barplot stacked (first) and filled to 100% (second), created by Hourglass."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/plots/profile barplot stacked.png","images/plots/profile barplot filled.png"))
```

8. **Expression Heatmap**
+ Provides overview of patterns in stain data. When there are no NA/missing values (in imputed version for example), values will be clustered using unsupervised hierarchal clustering.
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%", fig.align = "center", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Heatmap showing expression of features, created by Hourglass."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/plots/heatmap expression.png"))
```

9. **Fold-change (FC) p-value Heatmap**
+ Screen for patterns of fold-changes between strata in comparisons and overall significance seen in individuals boxplots.  
+ Fold-changes of strata are shown as color gradient and significance between two groups are presented as stars/numbers.
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="55%", fig.align = "center", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Plot showing fold-change values (color gradients) and p-values (stars/number), created by Hourglass."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/plots/heatmap pval FC.png"))
```

10. **Correlation Plot**
+ Provides correlations between cell communities and their interactions, e.g. of an insight that can be drawn: correlations between fibroblast markers in one cancer subtype and anti-correlated with immune cells in another. Can only be performed on imputed (no missing values) dataset.
+ spearman or pearson
+ Only created when there are no NA/missing values - for example in 1) imputed version, and 2) "complete" rows in feature sets.
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align = "center", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Correlation plot created by Hourglass."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/plots/correlation.png"))
```

11. **Correlation Scatter Plot**
+ Provides details of correlations, such as regression, scatter plots, correlation coefficients and significant and histograms of values used. Can only be performed on imputed (no missing values) dataset.
+ Only created when there are no NA/missing values - for example in 1) imputed version, and 2) "complete" rows in feature setsc
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%", fig.align = "center", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Correlation scatter plot created by Hourglass."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/plots/correlation scatter.png"))
```

12. **ID Table** 
+ Provides sample/patient ID and strata used in comparison, useful for custom comparisons (where groups are assigned by Hourglass) and to see which samples/patients were included after filter inclusion/exclusion.
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%", fig.align = "center", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="ID table (csv file) created by Hourglass."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/plots/id_table.png"))
```

## Quality Control (QC) Plots

Purpose:

*  Informs whether anything is skewed in a comparison. For example, the overall number of positive cells for that stain is higher in high groups (a problem).  
* Verify that a specific metric or data point exists for a stain.  
* Visualized using boxplots (individual and overview).  

Types:

* **QC Feature**: Plot all parameters present for a feature, split by comparison. Note: If your "feature column" parameter is called "Stain", this folder will be called "QC Stain" in the output folder.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align = "center", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Example of a 'QC feature' overview boxplot (all parameters measured for CD3)."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/plots/QC feature.png"))
```

* **QC Parameter**: Plot all features present for a parameter, split by comparison

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align = "center", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Example of a 'QC parameter' overview boxplot (all features that have a readout for Num.Pos.per.mm.2)."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/plots/QC parameter.png"))
```

## Feature Sets Plots

Purpose:  
* Group relevant features (_e.g._ biologically relevant). 

See [Define Feature Sets] for workflow/user specifications. Briefly: 
  
**Step 1: Specify relevant parameters for each stain.**   
* If multiple parameters are present per feature (usually the case in multiparametric imaging data), most will be irrelevant/for QC. The final readout is usually a ratio: (1) /(2), where (1) is quantification metric and (2) is normalization metric.
  
**Step 2: Make groups, the data integration step.** 
* Look at a stain in context of other stains within the dataset. Make smaller groups (e.g. T cell, immune, stromal cell features).   
* Multiple plot types are supported for feature sets.
